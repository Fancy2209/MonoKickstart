About MonoKickstart
-------------------
Originally developed by Edward Rudd for Bastion, MonoKickstart is a reworking of
the stock generated kickstart code from Mono to easily run C# applications on
*nix platforms. macOS support was added in 2013 for FNA titles.

About the precompiled/ Folder
-----------------------------
We have provided a precompiled MonoKickstart application for you to use in your
programs. Included are kick binaries and libmono binaries for macOS and Linux
(64-bit only). We have also provided the subset of the C# BCL needed by FNA as
well as a "./Kick" script to automatically choose the right binary for the
operating system and architecture.

To use the precompiled MonoKickstart, simply rename the kick.bin.* binaries to
the name of your .exe assembly (for instance, MyGame.bin.x86 starts MyGame.exe).
Additionally, modify "Kick" to run those newly named kick binaries rather than
the generic "kick" name. The name of "Kick" itself can be whatever you like.

If you wish to use additional shared libraries (for instance, libSDL2), simply
add the library to the architecture's lib folder:

macOS: osx/
Linux (64-bit): lib64/
Linux (32-bit): lib/
